The unknown severity level is reserved for misbehaviors we observe in the codebase that cannot be quantified using the above metrics. Examples of such vulnerabilities include potentially desirable system behavior that is undocumented, reliance on external dependencies that are out-of-scope but could result in some form of vulnerability arising, use of external out-of-scope contracts that appears incorrect but cannot be pinpointed, and other such vulnerabilities.

In general, unknown severity level vulnerabilities require follow-up information by the project being audited and are either adjusted in severity (if valid), or marked as nullified (if invalid).

Additionally, the unknown severity level is sometimes assigned to centralization issues that cannot be assessed in likelihood due to their exploitation being tied to the honesty of the project's team.
